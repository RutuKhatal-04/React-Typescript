Why TypeScript + React ?
With static type checking you get to learn about potential bug as you are typing the code than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime
Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete
Make maintainance and refactoring of large code bases much easier




TypeScript is just frustrating most of the time
we have to write a lot code than i normally do and the compiler keeps complaining .
